1. JavaScript's three primitive data types are string, number and boolean

2. the only two values available to the Boolean data type are true and false

3. If you create a variable but don't set a value, the variable holds the data type Undefined

4. to convert a Number to a String in JavaScript, use toString(): 2.toString() if the number is 2

5. the built-in function/method to determine the length of a given String is length(): "hello".length() if the string is "hello"

Code Practice

var name="Doris";
console.log(name.charAt(0));
